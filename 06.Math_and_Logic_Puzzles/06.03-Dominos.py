06.03 Dominos: There is an 8x8 chessboard in which two diagonally opposite corners have been cut off.
    You are given 31 dominos, and a single domino can cover exactly two squares. Can you use the 31
    dominos to cover the entire board? Prove your answer (by providing an example or showing why
    it's impossible).

Answer:
    It is impossible to cover the entire 8x8 chessboard with 31 dominos after two diagonally
    opposite corners have been cut off because the remaining squares have an unequal
    distribution of colors, and each domino covers one square of each color. Thus, there will
    always be one square left uncovered, making complete coverage impossible.
